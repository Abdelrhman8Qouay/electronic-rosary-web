[how to configure webpack from scratch for a basic website](https://dev.to/antonmelnyk/how-to-configure-webpack-from-scratch-for-a-basic-website-46a5)

To run Webpack, we have to use npm script with simple command webpack and our configuration file as config option. Our package.json should look like this for now:
"scripts": {
    "build": "webpack --config webpack.config.js"
  },


With that basic setup, you can run $ npm run build command. Webpack will look up our entry file, resolve all import module dependencies inside it and bundle it into single .js file in dist folder. In the console, you should see something like this:
```
npm run build
```
